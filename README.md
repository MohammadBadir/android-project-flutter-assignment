1.The "snappingSheetController" class is used to implement the controller pattern for the snapping_sheet library.
It gives the developer access to the following properties:
-currentSnapPosition: The current snap position of the SnappingSheet
-hashCode: The object's hashcode
-runtimeType: Representation of the objecy's runtime type.
-snapPositions: The different snap positions the SnappingSHeet currently has.

2.The "snappingCurve" parameter for each SnapPosition in the snapPositions list.

3.Inkwell's advantage: Produces a Material Design ripple effect for the various taps (for visual aid).
GestureDetector's advantage: Allows for more control and custom effects that don't necessarily follow the material design guidelines
